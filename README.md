WELCOME LEARNTOBECOMEBETTER

WHO I AM: I am not very good when it comes to math, but i know computers, and i am starting to learn Linux/android.
I live in Oregon near Astoria. I started learning Linux when i rooted my first cellphone, and only time i could do it, because of the complcations of the newwer Android OS.

I want to learn all I can, because we need to become better. I want to build my own system one day.

LEVEL 0.5 Read_only_systems. learning is key, and messing with one letter/symbol can reck everything.

thanks for the time to read this
